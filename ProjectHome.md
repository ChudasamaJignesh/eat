## Basics: ##
You are the green circle in the game screen. Your goal is to eat as much food as you can.
Food is symbolized by the yellow objects fallingdown the screen. Red food or the fishes are to avoid as they will get you killed. Also, if the food reaches the bottom of the screen, you'll lose one live!
When you reached a score of 20, you made the first stage. From there on every twenty points will get you to the next stageand the higher you get, the more food and enemies will appear.
